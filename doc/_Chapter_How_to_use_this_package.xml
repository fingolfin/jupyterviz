<Heading>Purpose</Heading>

<P/>
Since 2017, it has been possible to use &GAP; in
<URL Text="Jupyter">http://jupyter.org/</URL> through the
<Package>JupyterKernel</Package> package. Output was limited to the
ordinary text output &GAP; produces; charts and graphs were not possible.
<P/>
In 2018, Martins and Pfeiffer released <Package>francy</Package>
(<URL Text="repository">https://github.com/mcmartins/francy</URL>,
<URL Text="article">https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08648</URL>), which lets
users create graphs of a few types (vertices and edges, line chart, bar
chart, scatter chart). It also allows the user to attach actions to the
elements of these charts, which result in callbacks to &GAP; that can
update the visualization.
<P/>
This package aims to make a wider variety of visualizations accessible to
&GAP; users, but does not provide tools for conveniently making such
visualizations interactive. Where the
<Package>francy</Package> package excels at interactive visualizations,
this package instead gives a broader scope of visualization tools.
<P/>
This is achieved by importing several existing JavaScript visualization
toolkits and exposing them to &GAP; code, as described later in this
manual.
<P/>
The toolkits currently exposed by this package are listed here.
We split them into four categories: plot tools (which make
visualizations such as bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, etc.),
graph tools (which make vertex-and-edge graphs), 3D tools
(planned for addition in a future version of this package), and low-level
tools that are very general-purpose, and thus with which you can build
whatever you want (with effort).

<Heading>Loading the package into a Jupyter notebook</Heading>

<P/>
To import the package into a Jupyter notebook, do so just as with any
other &GAP; package: Ensure that the kernel of the notebook is a &GAP;
kernel, then execute the following code in one of the notebook cells.
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[
LoadPackage( "jupyterviz" );

<Section Label="Chapter_How_to_use_this_package_Section_Creating_a_visualization">
<Heading>Creating a visualization</Heading>

<P/>
Visualizations of any kind supported by this package are created through
one function, <Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/>. You can view its
complete documentation in for details, but examples are given in this
section.
<P/>
Nearly all visualizations in this package are created by passing data to
the <Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/> function as records describing
what to draw. These records are converted into
<URL Text="JSON">http://www.json.org/</URL> form by the
<Package>json</Package> package, and handed to whichever JavaScript
toolkit you have chosen to use for creating the visualization.
<P/>
<Subsection Label="Chapter_How_to_use_this_package_Section_Creating_a_visualization_Subsection_Example_AnyChart">
<Heading>Example: AnyChart</Heading>

<P/>
The AnyChart website contains
<URL Text="documentation">https://docs.anychart.com/Working_with_Data/Data_From_JSON</URL>
on how to create visualizations from JSON data. Following those
conventions, we could give AnyChart the following JSON to produce a pie
chart.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
{
    "chart" : {
        "type" : "pie",
        "data" : [
            { "x" : "Subgroups of order 6", "value" : 1 },
            { "x" : "Subgroups of order 3", "value" : 1 },
            { "x" : "Subgroups of order 2", "value" : 3 },
            { "x" : "Subgroups of order 1", "value" : 1 }
        ]
    }
}
]]></Log>


<P/>
In &GAP;, the same data would be represented with a record, as follows.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
myChartData := rec(
    chart := rec(
        type := "pie",
        data := [
            rec( x := "Subgroups of order 6", value := 1 ),
            rec( x := "Subgroups of order 3", value := 1 ),
            rec( x := "Subgroups of order 2", value := 3 ),
            rec( x := "Subgroups of order 1", value := 1 )
        ]
    )
);
]]></Log>


<P/>
We can ask &GAP;, running in a Jupyter notebook, to create a
visualization from this data by passing that data directly to
<Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/>. We wrap it in a record that must
specify the tool to use (in this case <Code>"anychart"</Code>) and
optionally some other details not relevant here.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
CreateVisualization( rec( tool := "anychart", data := myChartData ) );
]]></Log>

<P/>
If you have the data defining a visualization stored in a
<File>.json</File> file on disk, you can use the following code rather
than rewriting the JSON code into &GAP; code yourself.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
CreateVisualization( rec(
    tool := "anychart",
    data := JsonStringToGap( ReadAll( InputTextFile( "your-file.json" ) ) )
) );
]]></Log>


<P/>
AnyChart can make a wide variety of charts (area, bar, box, bubble, bullet,
column, doughnut, and so on, for over 125 different types and subtypes).
Other JavaScript libraries available also have similarly broad
capabilities, but we do not include here examples of CanvasJS, ChartJS,
or Plotly, because their capabilities and purpose are somewhat similar
to that of AnyChart. Though their data formats are different, you can
find links to those formats' documentation in the documentation for the
function <Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/>. So instead future sections
focus on four other examples that are unlike AnyChart.
<P/>
</Subsection>


<Subsection Label="Chapter_How_to_use_this_package_Section_Creating_a_visualization_Subsection_Post-processing_visualizations">
<Heading>Post-processing visualizations</Heading>

<P/>
Note that <Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/> takes an optional second
parameter, a string of JavaScript code to be run once the visualization
is complete. For example, if the visualization library did not support a
solid black border, but you wanted to add one, you could do so in
subsequent code.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
CreateVisualization(
    sameDataAsAbove, # plus this new second parameter:
    "visualization.style.border = '5px solid black'"
)
]]></Log>


<P/>
This holds for any visualization tool, not just AnyChart. In the code
given in the second parameter, two variables will be defined for your
use: <Code>element</Code> refers to the output cell element in the
notebook and <Code>visualization</Code> refers to the visualization that
the toolkit you chose created within that output cell (also an HTML
element).
<P/>
</Subsection>


<Subsection Label="Chapter_How_to_use_this_package_Section_Creating_a_visualization_Subsection_Example_Cytoscape">
<Heading>Example: Cytoscape</Heading>

<P/>
Unlike AnyChart, Cytoscape is for the vertices-and-edges type of graph,
not the x-and-y-axes type. A tiny Cytoscape graph (just <Math>A\to B</Math>) is
represented by the following JSON.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
{
    elements : [
        { data : { id : "A" } },
        { data : { id : "B" } },
        { data : { id : "edge", source : "A", target : "B" } }
    ],
    layout : { name : "grid", rows : 1 }
}
]]></Log>


<P/>
Cytoscape graphs can also have style attributes not shown here.
<P/>
Rather than copy this data directly into &GAP;, let's generate graph
data in the same format using &GAP; code. Here we make a graph of the
first 50 positive integers, with <Math>n\to m</Math> iff <Math>n\mid m</Math> (ordinary integer
divisibility).
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
N := 50;
elements := [ ];
roots := [ ];
for i in [2..N] do
    Add( elements, rec( data := rec( id := String( i ) ) ) );
    if IsPrime( i ) then
        Add( roots, i );
    fi;
    for j in [2..i-1] do
        if i mod j = 0 then
            Add( elements, rec( data := rec(
                source := String( j ),
                target := String( i ) ) ) );
        fi;
    od;
od;
]]></Log>


<P/>
We then need to choose a layout algorithm. The Cytoscape documentation
suggests that the "cose" layout works well. Here, we do choose a height
(in pixels) for the result, because Cytoscape does not automaticlly
resize visualizations to fit their contents. We also set the style for
each node to display its ID (which is the integer associated with it).
<P/>
All the code below comes directly from translating the Cytoscape
documentation from JSON form to &GAP; record form. See that
documentation for more details; it is cited in the documentation for the
<Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/> function.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
CreateVisualization( rec(
    tool := "cytoscape",
    height := 600,
    data := rec(
        elements := elements, # computed in the code above
        layout := rec( name := "cose" ),
        style := [
            rec( selector := "node", style := rec( content := "data(id)" ) )
        ]
    )
) );

<Heading>Example: D3</Heading>

<P/>
While D3 is one of the most famous and powerful JavaScript visualization
libraries, it does not have a JSON interface. Consequently, we can
interact with D3 only through the JavaScript code passed in the second
parameter to <Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/>. This makes it much less
convenient, but we include it in this package for those who need it.
<P/>

You can create a blank canvas, then use the existing JavaScript canvas
API to draw on it.

This is the degenerate example of a visualization. It does not create
any visualization, but lets you specify arbitrary HTML content instead.
It is provided here merely as a convenient way to insert HTML into the
notebook.
