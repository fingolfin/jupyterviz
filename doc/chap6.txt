  [33X[0;0YWhen  this package is being used in a Jupyter Notebook, it has the following
  limitations.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIf a notebook with visualizations created by this package is saved and
        later  reloaded,  the  visualizations  will  not persist. They will be
        replaced  by  an error message instructing the user to re-run the cell
        that  created the visualization. This limitation may be removable with
        some refactoring of the internal workings of this package.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  [10Xnbconvert[110X  tool,  which converts [11X.ipynb[111X files into other formats,
        will  not  include  the  visualizations,  because  [10Xnbconvert[110X  is not a
        browser  that  can  evaluate  the  JavaScript  code that generates the
        visualizations.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YSince  most  visualizations load a JavaScript library from a CDN, they
        require a working Internet connection to function.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen  it  is  being  used  from  the  command  line,  it  has  the following
  limitations.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  JavaScript  function  [10XrunGAP[110X  introduced  in  Section  [14X4.3[114X is not
        available.  That  function depends upon the ability to ask the Jupyter
        Kernel to run [5XGAP[105X code, and thus when there is no Jupyter Kernel, that
        function cannot work.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YEach    new    call   to   [2XPlot[102X   ([14X7.1-1[114X),   [2XPlotGraph[102X   ([14X7.1-3[114X),   or
        [2XCreateVisualization[102X  ([14X7.2-5[114X) will be stored in a new temporary file on
        the  user's  filesystem  and  thus shown in a new tab or window in the
        user's  browser.  That  is,  one does not iteratively improve a single
        visualization,  but  is  forced  to  open a new window or tab for each
        call.[133X
