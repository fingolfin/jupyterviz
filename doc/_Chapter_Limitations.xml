<P/>
The functions in this package depend upon being evaluated in a live
Jupyter Notebook. This brings up a few limitations:
<P/>
<List>
<Item>
If a notebook with visualizations created by this package is saved and
later reloaded, the visualizations will not persist. They will be
replaced by an error message instructing the user to re-run the cell
that created the visualization. This limitation may be removable with
some refactoring of the internal workings of this package.
</Item>
<Item>
The <Code>nbconvert</Code> tool, which converts <File>.ipynb</File>
files into other formats, will not include the visualizations, because
<Code>nbconvert</Code> is not a browser that can evaluate the
JavaScript code that generates the visualizations.
</Item>
<Item>
Since most visualizations load a JavaScript library from a CDN, they
require a working Internet connection to function.
